# Future Age Calculator

# Prompt the user for their current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the user's age in 2050
# Assuming current year is 2023, so we add 27 years (2050 - 2023 = 27)
future_age = current_age + 27

# Print the result
print(f"In 2050, you will be {future_age} years old")
